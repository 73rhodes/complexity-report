# complexityReport.js

A tool for reporting code complexity metrics in JavaScript projects
(still in development).

The metrics are calculated by walking syntax trees
generated by the [Esprima] parser.

[![Build status][ci-image]][ci-status]

## Installation

```
npm install complexity-report
```

## Usage

### Loading the library

```
var complexityReport = require('complexity-report');
```

### Calling the library

#### From the command line

```
complexity-report [options] <file...>
```

##### Options

* `-o <file>`: Specify an output file for the report.
* `-f <format`: Specify an output format for the report.
* `-th <threshold>`: Specify the per-function complexity threshold.
* `-lo`: Disregads operator `||` as a source of cyclomatic complexity.
* `-sc`: Disegards switch statements as a source of cyclomatic complexity.
* `-fi`: Treats for...in loops as a source of cyclomatic complexity.
* `-tc`: Treats catch clauses as a source of cyclomatic complexity.

##### Output formats

These are loaded with `require` from the `src/formats` subdirectory.
Adding new formats is easy,
each module must export a function `format`
that takes a report object as its only argument
and returns a string representation of the report.
See `src/formats/plain.js` for an example format.

#### From code

### Examples

## Development

### Dependencies

The build environment relies on [Node.js][node], [NPM], [Jake], [JSHint],
[Mocha], [Chai] and [UglifyJS]. Assuming that you already have Node.js
and NPM set up, you just need to run `npm install` to install all of the
dependencies as listed in `package.json`.

### Unit tests

The unit tests are in `test/complexityReport.js`. You can run them with the
command `npm test` or `jake test`.
